## Getting Started

First, install the package on your project via NPM.

```
npm i @katreque/tempojs --save
```

Here's a quick example of what to use in order to develop your game. Further documentation will added soon. :)

```javascript
const { Action, GameLoop, Player, eventListener, GLOBAL_EVENTS } = require('tempojs');

class MyPlayer extends Player {
    constructor(id, Actions, name) {
        super(id, Actions);
        this.name = name;
    }
}

class MyAction extends Action {
    constructor(name, priority, subPriority) {
        super(name, priority, subPriority);
    }

    //The logic behind this Action.
    run() {
        console.log(
            `Name: ${this.name}, Priority: ${this.priority}, SubPriority: ${this.subPriority}`
        );
    }
}

const MA1 = new MyAction('Action 1', 1, 1);
const MA2 = new MyAction('Action 2', 1, 2);

const Player1 = new MyPlayer(1, [MA1], 'Pog Player');
const Player2 = new MyPlayer(2, [MA2], 'Noob Player');

//New Game Instance
const Game = new GameLoop([Player1, Player2], []);

//Global Events Listeners
eventListener(GLOBAL_EVENTS.turnEnded, () => {
    console.log('End of turn.');
});

//Run one turn of the game
Game.runGameIteration();

/*
Output:

Name: Action 1, Priority: 1, SubPriority: 1
Name: Action 2, Priority: 1, SubPriority: 2
End of turn.
*/
```
